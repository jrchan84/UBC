We observe that aRead is significantly faster than sRead, and that even for
different inputs, aRead's computation time does not seem to grow significantly.
Compared to sRead, which waits for the disk to transfer the data, aRead
requests the next disk reads while waiting for the data to be transferred.
This results in the shorter computation time as disk transfers can run in parallel
and summation is a quick computation that doesn't affect time too much.
